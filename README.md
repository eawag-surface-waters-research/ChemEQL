ChemEQL
=======

ChemEQL calculates and draws **thermodynamic equilibrium** concentrations of species in complex chemical systems.
It handles **homogeneous solutions, dissolution, precipitation, titrations** with acids, bases, or other components.
**Adsorption** on up to five different particulate surfaces can be modeled with the choice of the Constant Capacitance,
Diffuse Layer (Generalized Two Layer), Basic Stern Layer, or Triple Layer model to consider surface charges.
Corrections for ionic strength can be made and **activities** calculated. **Kinetic reactions** can be simulated with
one rate determining process in a system of otherwise fast thermodynamic chemical equilibrium. **Two-dimensional
logarithmic diagrams**, such as pe-pH, or generally pX vs. pY, can be calculated. A drawing option is implemented.

A **library** with over 1750 thermodynamic stability constants allows quick access, comfortable creation of
input matrices and hence easy use of the program. A second library contains more than 300 solubility products
hat can be introduced if **solid phases** are modeled. Both libraries can be altered and extended with new reactions
and stability constants. Output data are formatted for .xls or for import in a graphic program.

ChemEQL 4 is currently under development. It is based on Java 8 / JavaFX and builds on its predeccessor ChemEQL 3
being a Java port of a native Mac OS 9 application that in turn was an extended and user-friendly version of the
original program MICROQL by John Westall. ChemEQL 4 is open source.

ChemEQL 3.1 and its manual with many representative examples are available at:
